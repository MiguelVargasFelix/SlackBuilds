cm-unicode (Computer Modern Unicode OTF fonts)

Computer Modern Unicode fonts were converted from metafont sources
using mftrace with autotrace backend and fontforge. Their main purpose
is to create free good quality fonts for use in X applications
supporting many languages.
Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the
typesetting program TeX. It was created by Donald Knuth with his
Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992.
Computer Modern, or variants of it, remains very widely used in
scientific publishing.
