solvespace (parametric 2d/3d CAD tool)

SolveSpace is a free and open-source 2D/3D constraint-based parametric
computer-aided design (CAD) software that supports basic 2D and 3D
constructive solid geometry modeling.

It is possible to export models as a whole or in part to various
formats such as PDF, SVG, or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS).

It was initially created by Jonathan Westhues and as of 2022 is
maintained by a community of volunteers.


The instructions for building SolveSpace don't provide a way to do it
without clonning it from their repositry:

https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace/?tab=readme-ov-file#via-source-code

You can download the .tar.gz file from the repository releases, but
it fails to build, because with it you cannot do the needed command:

git submodule update --init

So, this slackbuild clones the SolveSpace repository and checkouts
the 3.1 version.
