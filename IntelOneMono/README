IntelOneMono (expressive monospaced font family)

Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family that's built
with clarity, legibility, and the needs of developers in mind.

It's easier to read, and available for free, with an open-source
font license. Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision
developer audience, Frere-Jones Type designed the Intel One Mono
typeface in partnership with the Intel Brand Team and VMLY&R, for
maximum legibility to address developers' fatigue and eyestrain and
reduce coding errors. A panel of low-vision and legally blind
developers provided feedback at each stage of design.
